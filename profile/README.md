Welcome to the Busy Sloths Community! 🦥

We're a group of developers building robust and scalable machine learning solutions with a little bit of sloth-like patience and a lot of focus.

Our flagship project is mlox, the "MLOps-in-a-Box" framework. It's designed to help you handle MLOps services and infrastructure with ease and efficiency, just like a sloth on a mission.
